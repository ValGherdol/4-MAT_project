>>> Description :
> This file contains all the parameters necessary in order to run the [FINAL NAME OF THE PROGRAM].
> All parameters are sorted according to the step of the program they are used in. 
> For each step, a desciption of all it's parameters is written before the actual parameters' list. 
> These descriptions also indicates if a given parameter is MANDATORY, OPTIONAL or TRIVIAL.
> Mandatory parameters are to be custom-given by the user. 
> Optional parameters can be either custom-given or set to their default value by writting the word 'default'.
> Trivial parameters are a subclass of optional parameters who possess no default value but also doesn't change the analysis' results.
>	The possible settings are specified for each trivial parameter.
> CAUTION : When setting a parameter, make sure to leave a space on each side of the colon (:).

>>> Initial data
> (1) MANDATORY : A text file listing the pool of genes shared by all provided datasets. 
> (2) MANDATORY : A set of text files (each separated by a coma ',') listing genes of interest from different categories. All genes from these lists don't have 
>		  to be in the global gene pool but it is highly advised that a given gene is not in more than one list. You can also put the word 'None' if
>		  you don't have any genes of interest.
> (3) OPTIONAL : A set of labels (each separated by a coma ',') to differenciate the categories of anchor genes.
>		 CAUTION : If you provide a custom value, make sure to give as much labels as you gave lists of anchor genes.
>	Default value = anchor genes are labeles 'Anchor X' with X following the order of the provided anchor lists (i.e. 1st list's genes are labeled
>			'Anchor 1', 2nd list's genes are labeled 'Anchor 2', and so on...).
> (4) OPTIONAL : A set of tuples (each tuple separated by a slash '/') of float values (each value separated by a coma ',') indicating the rgb colors of 
>		 the points representing anchor genes in the KNN network. All non-anchor genes are coloured black.
>		 CAUTION : If you provide a custom value, make sure to give as much tuples as you gave lists of anchor genes.
>	Default value : all points are coloured black, be they anchor or not.
> (5) MANDATORY : A set of Integers (each separated by a coma ',') indicating which steps of the analysis you wish to run.
>		  CAUTION 1 : If you wish not to run any analysis step, set the parameter to '0'.
>		  CAUTION 2 : Providing at least one anchor genes list is necessary if you wish to run Step 3. The remaining Steps 1,2 and 4 can run without
>			      any anchor gene.
> (6) MANDATORY : An Integer indicating if you wish for a consensus of the analysis to be calculated (0=No , 1=Yes).
> (7) OPTIONAL : A pickle file containing a dictionnary listing for each anchor gene the lists of other genes linked to it according to each analysis step.
>		 CAUTION 1 : If you provide a custom value (which means a preexisting dictionary), keep in mind that any step result already in the dictionary
>			     will be overwritten if you rerun the same step.
>		 CAUTION 2 : If you don't provide any anchor genes, the dictionary will be filled with the results for all genes in the global pool.
>	Default value = the creation of a new empty dictionnary.

>>> Step 1 : Co-Expression by Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
> (1) MANDATORY	: A Boolean-like Integer indicating if you wish for the correlations to be calculated between all couples of genes or only 
>		  between couples with at least one anchor gene (0=all couples , 1=with at least one anchor).
>		  CAUTION : This setting has a big impact of the processing time.
> (2) OPTIONAL : A Float or set of Floats (each separated by a coma ',') indicating the PCC's threshold to respect for each dataset.
>		 A single Float means the same threshold is used for all datasets. A set of Floats means each threshold is used for
>		 the corresponding dataset in the provided order.
>		 CAUTION : If you wish for no threshold(s), set the value(s) explicitly to 0.
>	Default value = 0.5 for all datasets.

> (4) OPTIONAL : A Float indicating the multiplication factor to use when calculating the dynamic Pearson threshold.
>	Default value = 1.
> (5) OPTIONAL : An Integer indicating the maximum number of neighbors a point cas have in the co-expression network.
>		 CAUTION : This step is dependant of the order in which the points are added to the network. For an unbiased result,
>			   it is recommended to use the default value, even though this means the network can be very heavy.
>	Default value = No maximum number of neighbors.
> (6) OPTIONAL : A set of Integers (separated by a coma ',') indicating the minimum number of anchor gene neighbors a candidate gene has to have
>		 in order to be considered worthy of further studies on it. Each integer is associated to the anchor gene list in the same position.
>	Default value = All candidates are kept regardless of their anchor neighborhood.
> (7) TRIVIAL : A Boolean-like Integer indicating if you wish to print the calculation time for each gene of the global pool as the analysis runs 
>		(0=No , 1=Yes).
> (8) TRIVIAL : A Boolean-like Integer indicating if you wish to print the execution time of each substep as the analysis runs (0=No , 1=Yes).

>>> Step 2 : K-Nearest Neighbors with Reciprocal Best Hit
> (1) MANDATORY : The version of the KNN algorithm you wish to use. Version 'KNN_1' calculates the standard algorthim in which the same number of
>		  nearest neighbors is calculated for all genes. Version 'KNN_2' calculates for each gene it's distance to all the other genes and
>		  customizes the number of nearest neighbors it keeps. (See the [Steps' README] for more details).
